# Bug Theory Reformulation After Failed Attempts

## Arguments
None required (assumes previous theories tested and failed)

If you don't know what issue I'm talking about, stop and ask me.

Issue details should be at `.work/<your_folder>/issue-<issue_number>/`
All investigations should be at `.work/<your_folder>/bug-<issue_number>-investigation-*.md`
Previous theories should be at `.work/<your_folder>/bug-<issue_number>-theories.md`
Failed test results should be at `.work/<your_folder>/bug-<issue_number>-test-results-*.md`

## Instructions

Formulate three new theories incorporating all lessons learned from failed reproduction attempts and expanded investigation.

### Goals
- Build on insights gained from what didn't work
- Incorporate newly discovered information from re-investigation
- Think beyond conventional failure modes
- Consider complex multi-factor scenarios

### Theory Formation Guidelines

**Learning from Failures:**
- Explicitly reference why each previous theory failed
- Identify what each failed test revealed about system behavior
- Use "negative results" as constraints for new theories
- Consider if failed tests were actually testing the wrong thing

**New Theory Requirements:**
- **One theory** may be a refined variation of a previous theory that addresses why reproduction failed
- **Two theories** must be genuinely novel approaches based on the expanded investigation
- Each theory must account for ALL symptoms AND explain why previous reproductions failed
- Consider multi-step or compound failure scenarios
- Think about state accumulation over time
- Explore non-deterministic or probabilistic failures

### Categories to Consider

**Complex Interaction Theories:**
- Multiple components failing in sequence
- Cascade failures from seemingly unrelated triggers
- Emergent behavior from system interactions
- Feedback loops or circular dependencies

**Hidden State Theories:**
- Persistent state in unexpected places
- Side effects from previous operations
- Memory/resource leaks affecting behavior
- Stale cache or inconsistent distributed state

**Environmental/Configuration Theories:**
- Feature flag combinations
- Deployment-specific settings
- Version mismatches or compatibility issues
- Infrastructure-level problems manifesting as app bugs

**Timing/Concurrency Theories:**
- Race conditions that are hard to reproduce
- Deadlocks or livelocks under specific loads
- Async operation ordering issues
- Event queue or message ordering problems

### Output
Write a revised theory report to `.work/<your_folder>/bug-<issue_number>-theories-round2.md` with:

For each of the three theories:
- **Theory name** (descriptive title)
- **Core hypothesis** (1-2 sentences)
- **Why previous attempts failed** (what we were missing)
- **New evidence supporting this theory** (from expanded investigation)
- **Specific trigger conditions** (more detailed than before)
- **Testability assessment** (why this theory is testable despite previous failures)
- **Confidence level** (high/medium/low) with justification

Additionally include:
- **Lessons learned summary** from all failed attempts
- **Key insights** that changed our understanding
- **Recommended testing approach** for these new theories

Focus on creative, outside-the-box thinking while remaining grounded in the evidence gathered.
